### TMu42

This is my personal GitHub account which I use mostly for private projects however I have a few public repositories which you are welcome to browse.

Iâ€™m currently working on:
 * A repository of solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I am hoping to make this public soon so that you may follow my work.
 * A repository implementing cellular automata with linear algebra. I am hoping to make this public soon so that you may follow my work.
 * A novelty minigolf style game with a few surprises. I am hoping to make this public soon so that you may follow my work.
