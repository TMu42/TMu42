### TMu42

This is my personal GitHub account which I use mostly for private projects however I have a few public repositories which you are welcome to browse.

Iâ€™m currently working on:
 * A repository of solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I am hoping to make this public soon so that you may follow my work.
 * A repository [`matrix-life`](https://github.com/TMu42/matrix-life) implementing [Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) with [Linear Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) using a [Model-View-Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) design pattern.
 * A novelty minigolf style game with a few surprises. I am hoping to make this public soon so that you may follow my work.
